## Summary

### Problme Statement

This paper defines density bursting subgraph (DBS) in temporal weighted graph, which is a subgraph that accumulates its density at the fastest speed during a time interval. The problme is that given a stream of smapshots of a temporal graph, find the DBS in this graph. This problem is NP-Hard. The burstiness is defined as follows:

$$ g(x,T)=\frac{\sum_{h=b+1}^e q_x(t_h)}{t_e-t_b}= \frac{x^TA(t_{b+1},t_e)x}{t_e-t_b} $$

The problem have 2 kinds of variance: Offline and online, find one and find top k.

### Solution

- Finding one DBS: Iteratively update $x$ by $T$ and update $T$ by $x$ untill $g(x,T)$ does not increase.
- Baseline: Use sliding window for each possible timespan, and find the DBS for each timespan.
- Solution: Find new indecomposable DBS candidates by randomly generate time intervals for Baseline.
- Online update: When new snapshot arrives, update DBS candidates in 3 conditions.

## Strong Point

- The problem defined in this paper has many novel applications.
- The case study is persuasive.
- The author conducts multiple experiments to show the effect of parameters.
- The solution for online update is inspiring.
